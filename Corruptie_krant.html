  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The courthouse has been built. After a long time, MatsDeJong09 finally finished building the courthouse he had been working on. As soon as Mechmanner heard this, he decided to sue MatsDeJong09 for the unjust removal of his chicken farm.
Since atheron was not online and MatsDeJong09 was the defendant, MythicalLyon took on the case. Strong arguments were made regarding why the removal of the chicken farm was wrong, but MatsDeJong09 stood firm in his defense.
As soon as the judge heard Mechmanner's compelling arguments, MatsDeJong09 referred to the "law," specifically article 3.1 of the Building Lawbook, which states that farms for personal use are forbidden on the server. However, Mechmanner countered this, arguing that the ruling was unfair for two reasons: first, the laws were enacted after his farm had already been removed and the items destroyed, and second, the law stipulates that the owner of a farm must receive a two-hour notice before the farm's removal.
MatsDeJong09 was dismissive of these points, repeating the "law" that he had established. But just as the judge began to lean in Mechmanner's favor, atheron logged into the game, causing the case to be reset.
Mechmanner suggested that MythicalLyon and atheron simply discuss the arguments that had already been made. He hoped to receive 64 cooked chickens, 64 feathers, and compensation for the items that were taken from his farm.
However, atheron ruled against Mechmanner, siding with MatsDeJong09. He ordered MatsDeJong09 to give Mechmanner one comparator, while atheron himself contributed two hoppers, as he claimed to be involved in the case.<br><br>
This left Mechmanner feeling disappointed, as he believed that the case had become corrupt once atheron took control. After the ruling, Mechmanner confided in me, expressing his deep disappointment with the entire debacle.</h3>

  On a lovely day Mechmanner was just strolling on spawn when suddenly: He got killed by MatsDeJong09! MatsDeJong09 said he had a reason but Mechmanner still doesn´t believe him.
  This debacle however, pushed MatsDeJong09 to make a lawbook! He asked _atheron_ to write it and it has gone in action ever since.
  Mechmanner also wanted some clarity about the building of stores and has written a seperate law book for that specific ground.
  MatsDeJong09 also found things to be unclear about the building of automatic farms, so now he have three lawbooks, All round, Stores and farms.
  This has also come with the arrival of permits! You now need a permit to build something or set up a store! The reactions have been positive thus far. <br>
    "This will clear up everything!" - MatsDeJong09

    <h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Patua One;">The first official buildings have been constructed!</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">
      _atheron_ thought: "If we have laws, we need buildings" and promptly left the server to begin on a build of order.
      It's the official building where the laws are written and conversations are made about them.
      MythicalLyon also wanted in on the fun and made a tiny tower for writing laws! The old law-writing room now is the office of _atheron_
      And MatsDeJong09 didn't want to be left out so he is making a courtroom, the first case will be about the removal of Mechmanner's chicken farm.
      Mechmanner also wanted to build a building but quickly realized that he isn't good at building and promptly left his creative world.
