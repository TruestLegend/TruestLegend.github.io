  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The courthouse has been built. After a long time, MatsDeJong09 finally finished building the courthouse he had been working on. As soon as Mechmanner heard this, he decided to sue MatsDeJong09 for the unjust removal of his chicken farm.
Since atheron was not online and MatsDeJong09 was the defendant, MythicalLyon took on the case. Strong arguments were made regarding why the removal of the chicken farm was wrong, but MatsDeJong09 stood firm in his defense.
As soon as the judge heard Mechmanner's compelling arguments, MatsDeJong09 referred to the "law," specifically article 3.1 of the Building Lawbook, which states that farms for personal use are forbidden on the server. However, Mechmanner countered this, arguing that the ruling was unfair for two reasons: first, the laws were enacted after his farm had already been removed and the items destroyed, and second, the law stipulates that the owner of a farm must receive a two-hour notice before the farm's removal.
MatsDeJong09 was dismissive of these points, repeating the "law" that he had established. But just as the judge began to lean in Mechmanner's favor, atheron logged into the game, causing the case to be reset.
Mechmanner suggested that MythicalLyon and atheron simply discuss the arguments that had already been made. He hoped to receive 64 cooked chickens, 64 feathers, and compensation for the items that were taken from his farm.
However, atheron ruled against Mechmanner, siding with MatsDeJong09. He ordered MatsDeJong09 to give Mechmanner one comparator, while atheron himself contributed two hoppers, as he claimed to be involved in the case.<br><br>
This left Mechmanner feeling disappointed, as he believed that the case had become corrupt once atheron took control. After the ruling, Mechmanner confided in me, expressing his deep disappointment with the entire debacle.</h3>

  Some whispers have found its way to the Mechmanner Courant. A new nation is rising whith the goal of equality.
