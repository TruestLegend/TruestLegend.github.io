    A slave breeding house has been made on the server!
  People are accepting that slaves are being locked up and tortured by zombies so they can trade with them!
  The building is located at the social district and is made of wood. MatsDeJong90 has gone one step further and made a contraption that scares some villagers constantly and makes them shit iron golems!
  Here follows an interview with a villagers:</h3>
  <h3> What do you think of the slave trading with villagers?</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> "Hrrr"</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> What did you say?</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> "He Heur"</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> Ehhm, what do you think of the zombies?</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> "He He Her?"</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> Sorry?</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> "Hrrrr"</h3>
  <h3></h3>
  <h3> Oh okay thanks!</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The first houses have been made on the server by MatsDeJong09 and MythicalLyon!
    They first decided to make a house together and share their items, but MythicalLyon had enough of it after some time.
    When he left ha alledegly pranked MatsDeJong09 by placing sculk sensors and shriekers under his floor so there was a constant roaring!
    But the dispute has been setteled.
    There have been some whispers about a giant flying spaceship but nothing has been seen or found jet.</h3>
