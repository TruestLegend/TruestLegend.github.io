  <h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Patua One;">Deep dark conqured!</h2>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The duo of MatsDeJong09 and MythicalLyon didn't seem to have enough of just conquering the end and thought: lets go to the most dangerous place in the overworld next!
  They managed to stay away from wardens and got enough Swift Sneak and horse armor for the horseshop to stay afloat for a while, more about the horse shop later.</h3>
  <hr>
  <h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Patua One;">Elytra restrictions revoked!</h2>

  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">
    While MatsDeJong09 tried to repair his elytra he realized: It's Too Expensive!
    So he revoked the rule where you can't have mending on your elytra.
    The reactions on his decision have been positive but a bit questioned by some.</h3>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;font-family:Patua One;">Supersonic horse has been made!</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">A horse with a speed of 14.21 blocks per second has been bred!
    People are scared that it will scare their pets and damage their houses but it has not been proven jet.
    A horse of 14.22 has been bread before, but it died of fall damage becouse Mechmanner wanted to know how fast it would go up the "cake tower".
    And becouse he felt bad (and wanted a horse buisness) he bred the aformetioned horses.</h3>
