<p2>Custom sounds!</p2>
<p3>After three weeks of trying things and failing i found out how to make custom sounds! It's super simple but i just couldn't find it anywhere! It is on beta (havent tried it out the normal page) but this is litteraly the code:
let {custom sound name} = music.fromWAV(Buffer.fromBase64("{Your base 64 string}"))
