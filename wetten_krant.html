  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">People woke up in shock when they realized: The cake tower is gone!
  Some people that are still unknown wanted to clean up spawn and in the process the giant cake tower has met the ground.
  The people are still shocked and baffled that the new government has let this happen. \n Some other things that have been cleaned up are:
  The villager breeder, the string duper, the achievement tower and the sugar cane farm.</h3>

  On a lovely day Mechmanner was just strolling on spawn when suddenly: He got killed by MatsDeJong09! MatsDeJong09 said he had a reason but Mechmanner still doesn´t believe him.
  This debacle however, pushed MatsDeJong09 to make a book with the law! He asked _atheron_ to write it and it has gone in action ever since.
  Mechmanner also wanted some clarity about the building of stores and has written a seperate law book for that specific ground.
  MatsDeJong09 also found things to be unclear about the building of automatic farms, so now he have three lawbooks, All round, Stores and farms.
  This has also come with the arrival of permits! You now need a permit to build something or set up a store! The reactions have been positive thus far. \n
    "This will clear up everything!" - MatsDeJong09

    <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">
      _atheron_ thought: "If we have laws, we need buildings" and promptly left the server to begin on a build of order.
      It's the official building where the laws are written and conversations are made about them.
      MythicalLyon also wanted in on the fun and made a tiny tower for writing laws! The old law-writing room now is the office of _atheron_
      And MatsDeJong09 didn't want to be left out so he is making a courtroom, the first case will be about the removal of Mechmanner's chicken farm.
      Mechmanner also wanted to build a building but quickly realized that he isn't good at building and promptly left his creative world.
