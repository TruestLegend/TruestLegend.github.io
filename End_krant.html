  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The enderdragon has been slain by three noble men called: Mechmanner, MatsDeJong09 en MythicalLyon.
  They went on this quest so they could obtain the fabled elytra and shulkerboxes.
  After a long and valiant fight by the trio they managed to end triumphant.
  There was a bit of a laugh when they realized that they went to a place with pillars and a flying lizard the size of a plane on september eleventh.
  And it was made even funnier when MythicalLyon used it's spyglass to inspect the dragon and it said: [Is it a plane?].
  The fight itself did not take any lives, but a death has been located in the end, More about that later.</h3>

    As the enderdragon was slain one of the three noble heroes wanted to loot the place immediately,
    im talking about of course: MatsDeJong09! But as he threw his enderpearl to go through the end gateway somthing horrible happened.
    The pearl didn't go through the gateway as planned but hit the bedrock and MatsDeJong09 fell down screaming!
    Luckily he realized after a few days that his grave spawned at y=0 and he could recover his items by going down with some water.
    Following is an interview with MatsDeJong09:</h3>
