  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The enderdragon has been slain by three noble men called: Mechmanner, MatsDeJong09 en MythicalLyon.
  They went on this quest so they could obtain the fabled elytra and shulkerboxes.
  After a long and valiant fight by the trio they managed to end triumphant.
  There was a bit of a laugh when they realized that they went to a place with pillars and a flying lizard the size of a plane on september eleventh.
  And it was made even funnier when MythicalLyon used it's spyglass to inspect the dragon and it said:</h3><h3 style="color:#55FF55;">[Is it a plane?]</h3><h3>.
  The fight itself did not take any lives, but a death has been located in the end. More about that later.</h3>
