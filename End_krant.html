  <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The enderdragon has been slain by three noble men called Mechmanner, MatsDeJong09 en MythicalLyon.
  They went on this quest so they could obtain the fabled elytra and shulkerboxes.
  After a long and valiant fight by the trio they managed to end triumphant.
  There was a bit of a laugh when they realized that they went to a place with pillars and a flying lizard the size of a plane on september eleventh.
  And it was made even funnier when MythicalLyon used it's spyglass to inspect the dragon and it said: [Is it a plane?].
  The fight itself did not take any lives, but a death has been located in the end, More about that later.</h3>

    As the enderdragon was slain one of the three noble heroes wanted to loot the place immediately,
    im talking about of course: MatsDeJong09! But as he threw his enderpearl to go through the end gateway something horrible happened.
    The pearl didn't go through the gateway as planned but hit the bedrock and MatsDeJong09 fell down screaming!
    Luckily he realized after a few days that his grave spawned at y=0 and he could recover his items by going down with some water.
    Following is an interview with MatsDeJong09:</h3>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;padding-left:30px;padding-right:30px;">The first elytra has been found by MythicalLyon.
    This however isn't a very big surprise because he is wounded on his leg and has to stay at home all day.
    But he couldn't be happy about his elytra for too long because of MatsDeJong09 and Mechmanner, because the wanted the server to stay fun and close together.
    There haven't been any rebels yet but there are rumors that MythicalLyon has not obeyed the rules.
    The rules that have been made are: No mending on elytra's are allowed.
    MatsDeJong however has decided that the rules he stated had been too harsh and included a datapack so bats drop phantom membrames.</h3>
